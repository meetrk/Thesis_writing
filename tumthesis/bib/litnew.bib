abstract = {When the estimated probabilities do not match the relative frequencies, we say these estimated probabilities are uncalibrated [39], which may cause incorrect decision making, and is particularly undesired in high-stakes tasks [45]. Knowledge Graph embedding models are reported to produce uncalibrated probabilities [36], e.g., for all the triples predicted with probability 0.9, the percentage of them being truly correct triples is not . In this article, we take a closer look at this problem. First, we confirmed the issue that typical KG Embedding models are uncalibrated. Then, we show how off-the-shelf calibration techniques can be used to mitigate this issue, among which binning-based calibration produces more calibrated probabilities. We also investigated the possible reasons for the uncalibrated probabilities and found that the expit transform, the way used to convert embedding scores into probabilities, is ineffective in most cases.},
